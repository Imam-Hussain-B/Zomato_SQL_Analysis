# Zomato  SQL Analytics Project
 ## üçΩÔ∏è Overview
 This project demonstrates advanced SQL data analysis using a real-world Zomato restaurant dataset. It
 showcases relational schema design, data normalization, analytical queries, and business insights
 generation.
 This README provides comprehensive documentation for understanding the project architecture,
 queries, and implementation. It is tailored for academic projects, portfolios, or data analyst interviews.
# üéØ Project Objectives

### 1. Data Modeling & Normalization
- Design a relational database schema using the principles of 3rd Normal Form (3NF) for the Zomato dataset.

- Separate composite and multi-valued attributes (e.g., cuisines) into appropriate junction tables for efficient querying.

### 2.Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Clean and transform the raw dataset using SQL or spreadsheet tools to ensure consistency, remove duplicates, and format boolean/numeric values.

### 3.Advanced SQL Query Development

- Write and optimize advanced SQL queries to extract business insights using:
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, NTILE)
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- JOINS across normalized tables

### 4. Real-world Business Problem Solving

- Analyze food trends, customer preferences, and pricing strategies using SQL.
- Address questions related to:

i) Top-rated restaurants by city
ii) Popular cuisines
iii) Delivery and booking patterns
iv) Location-based pricing and rating behavior

### 5.Performance & Best Practices

- Implement indexing strategies for large datasets.
- Structure queries for maintainability and performance optimization.

## üìÑ Schema Design

- Normalized using 3NF principles
- Separated into following tables:
  - restaurants
  - locations
  - cuisines
  - restaurant_cuisines (M:N junction)
  - pricing
  - ratings
  - services (table booking, online delivery)

Each table uses appropriate data types, foreign keys, and indexing.

## üîç Example Business Questions Answered

1. Top-rated restaurants by city and country
2. Most common cuisines by country
3. Online delivery restaurants with best ratings
4. Correlation between price range and rating
5. Detect cities with highest average spend
6. Which cuisine is most available for delivery?
7. Find missing/incomplete location records
8. Rating inconsistency (numeric vs text)
9. Cuisines with best and worst ratings
10. Detect high cost, low rated restaurants

All queries are documented and stored in `/sql/queries/`.
